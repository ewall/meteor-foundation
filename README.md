# Foundation 5.3.3 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ewall/meteor-foundation.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ewall/meteor-foundation)
#### An advanced responsive web framework by [ZURB](http://zurb.com/)

> This is a smart package for use with the [Meteor open-source web platform](http://meteor.com/) and the [Meteorite package manager](http://oortcloud.github.io/meteorite/). It is meant to be downloadable from the [Atmosphere package repository](https://atmospherejs.com/) or from [Github](https://github.com/ewall/meteor-foundation).

> *This package is now up-to-date with the latest Foundation 5.* If you are still on Foundation 4, check out my [Foundation-4](https://atmospherejs.com/package/Foundation-4) package instead.

> *This package includes Foundation's default CSS, and does **not** include SCSS files.* If you want to use SCSS, consider either the [foundation5-sass](https://atmospherejs.com/package/foundation5-sass) or [zf5](https://atmospherejs.com/package/zf5) packages, which are well-maintained by users more skilled with sassy CSS than I am.

[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) is an advanced responsive web framework. It features a flexible grid useful for rapid prototyping and mobile-ready design, and the results are beautiful, readable web sites. Version 4 was built with "Mobile First" RWD, semantic-friendly markup, and all new JavaScript. (Note that version 4 no longer supports IE 7 & 8—so hopefully you don't have to either!)

Checkout the [Kitchen Sink page](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/kitchen-sink.html) to view all the elements in their native splendor. Or browse the [Case Studies](http://foundation.zurb.com/case-jacquelinewest.php) to see some sites which were built with Foundation and get ideas how it can be tweaked and customized to fit your style.

## How to install 

1. `npm install -g meteorite` (if not already installed)
2. `mrt add foundation`
3. Minified CSS and JS files will be linked in your client-side code.
4. Foundation's JavaScripts are already initialized in your client.
